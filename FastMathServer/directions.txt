Copy 'wolframalpha' directory into your python library

mine was located at:
/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages


Also, tesseract must be installed on your system. It can be easily installed via homebrew.

NOTE: Tesseract has to already be installed in order to use test.py, and the command must be different 
	for macs than the ones used for windows
