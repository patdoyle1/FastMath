Google Glass FastMath

FastMath will be a project for those who want to experiment and develop applications for Google Glass. FastMath will be an application where we will utilize the image-processing feature of the Glass to look at a mathematical problem, and perform certain operations. We will be using an outside mathematical application, the job of the glass would be to recognize the function or formula and create the input to the external application. By the end of the semester we plan to have to have successfully recognized the formula or equation that is written down and creating a bridge between the glass and the other application.
