Wolfram Alpha todo list:
--> (DONE) get an AppID from products.wolframalpha.com/api in order to be able to query the server
--> learn the format of wolfram alpha output from documentation (refer to link below)


NOTE: we now have an AppID, which is:

	642Q4J-E5E9RP93XH 

This id must be used when querying the wolfram alpha site, otherwise they will not send any results (bad)

wolfram alpha documentation link:  http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/documentation.html
